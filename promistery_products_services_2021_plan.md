Products & Servies Promisetery

# Services

can be stacked on each other or as stand alone 

Im toying with the idea of people getting a membershipm like a $5 a year fee, private club.

Food Unit Group = a group of people(s) that combined spend $10k  - $25k a year

Im hoping to service around 100 - 200 FUGs a year ~ $1 - $5 million
We get there in steps.

We aim to be able to provide most of the food they need when they want it. Could be a subsciprtion and or a la carte as long as they spend that much. 

Outside of the 10 - 200 FUGs I want other people to come in. such as if someone wants to do a veg box CSA, of buy something time to time.
